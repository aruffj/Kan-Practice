# KanPractice TODO list

- Put 4 buttons instead of 2 for validating the input in any learning mode:
    - Failed: totally failed. Should submit 0%.
    - Hard: somehow got away with some of the kanji meaning, pronunciation or writing. Should count as 33%.
    - Good enough: got almost all the kanji meaning, pronunciation or writing perfectly learned. Should count as 66%.
    - Perfect: got it on the spot. Should count as 100%.
- Info of new version in the update available dialog from Firebase
- Refactor all labels and import easy_localization:
    - ES, EN, DE, FR
- Get a text to speech integration to hear the proper pronunciation on every learning mode
- Subject to popularity as it is a breaking change --> Make kan lists available (users decide which lists to upload) for everyone to download in an in-app market
- Open to suggestions :)

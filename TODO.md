# KanPractice TODO list

- Info of new version in the update available dialog from Firebase
- Add more languages  
- (Maybe) Refactor all labels and import easy_localization:
    - Remove "kanji" references to make it universal
- Get a text to speech integration to hear the proper pronunciation on every learning mode
- Subject to popularity as it is a breaking change --> Make kan lists available (users decide which lists to upload) for everyone to download in an in-app market
- Open to suggestions :)

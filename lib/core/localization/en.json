Here you can do various things like: create lists, view your progress in each list, filter, search and take tests.\n\n(1): When you click here, a dialog will be displayed to enter the name of the new vocabulary list. When created, it will appear in the list.\n\n(2): These are the two actions to perform tests. On the one hand, the 'lightning bolt' is the Blitz Tests, tests consisting of 30 random words belonging to all your lists. On the other hand, the 'circle' are tests that you can customize, choosing which lists you want to be included.In both modes you can select what type of learning you want: writing, reading or recognition.\n\n(3): Example list. You will be able to see your progress in each type of learning. Clicking on this will take you to the detail view. If you leave it pressed, you can delete the list.",
  "tutorial_lists": "This is the detail view of a list. Here you will see all the words included in the list, with several other options.\n\n(1): Adding words. By clicking here, you can create a new word in the list. You can add: transcription, meaning and pronunciation.\n\n(2): This is how the words are displayed. Each word will vary in color depending on how well or badly you are learning it. You will be able to click on each one to see more details.\n\n(3): Learning mode. Mode in which you learn and study the list. By default it is spatial learning (first the words you know the least), but you can also practice with the random mode. To switch between one and the other, just click on the icon.\n\n(4): Type of learning, among which are writing, reading and recognition. To switch between them, drag the list from right to left and vice versa. The words will change color showing you your progress in each type.\n\n(5): Practice Button. By pressing this button, you will start the training depending on the type of learning in which you are. Once the training is done, the stats are updated automatically.\n\n(6): List's name. By pressing the name, you will be able to change the name of the whole list.",

  "tutorial_writing": "Let's start going through the views of the main learning types. This is the Writing view.\n\n(1): Each word to be practiced will be shown here, above the (2) writing area. The kanji to be written will be denoted in red with the symbol ?, while those already written, in black.\n\n(3): Once a kanji is written, the symbol ? is replaced by the kanji itself and you will be the one to validate the level of success with these four levels: Bad, Partial, Good and Perfect. Depending on the level of validation, a percentage will be assigned to the kanji of the word, which will determine the total level of learning for that word once the practice or test is finished.\n\n(4): This is simply a help or guide to know how to make the kanji strokes correctly. It redirects to a web page.",
  "tutorial_reading": "This is the Reading view.\n\n(1): In this type of learning we try to know how the word is pronounced, therefore, each word will be shown in its entirety, except for its pronunciation and meaning.\n\n(2): Once we have said it out loud or thought its pronunciation, we must validate it, as in writing. To help us, the whole word will be shown with its pronunciation and meaning, as well as its romanized transcription.",
  "tutorial_recognition": "This is the Recognition view.\n\n(1): In this type of learning we try to recognize the word as soon as we see it, therefore, each word can be seen completely, except for its pronunciation and its meaning.\n\n(2): Once we have said it out loud or thought its meaning, we must validate it, as in writing. To help us, the whole word will be displayed with its pronunciation and meaning.",
  "tutorial_tests": "This is the list of tests performed. It can be accessed through the Settings. Only the last 10 tests will be displayed.\n\n(1): This represents a completed test in which you can see the grade obtained, the test mode, the type of learning and the date you took the test.\n\nENJOY LEARNING!"
